# Simmulated-Annealing
These are matlab codes that solve the Facility Layout Problem (FLP) using simmulated annealing. The use is easy: simply execute the .m file in each directory.

The result is the adjustement of the departments of an organization into a building of given floors and area available. Each department has its own size and there is a cost to minimize in transporting materials from one department to the next.

The problem is solved in two steps: first, minimizing the cost of floor organization (in which departments are assigned to a specific floor) and second, minimizing the cost per floor (organizing each department into a specific location within the floor).
